 ===========================

 3. HOW TO BUILD THE SOURCES
 ===========================
 
 You find the tool's sources in folder src/. We haven't a build script such as
 build.xml yet, so you should import the sources in your prefered IDE and ini-
 tiate a build there.

 You must add the src/WEB-INF/lib/ folder and the jars jsp-api.jar and 
 servlet-api.jar library e.g. from a tomcat installation to the build path.
