INSTALL-INFO
============

See doc/manual/manual_ger.pdf for datailed installation instructions. 

Because there is no english installation guideline available at the
moment, I will describe a short guide in the following. Note all steps
have to be done as root.

1. Download the ATFrogs.tar.gz archive and extract it:
     tar -xzvf ATFrogs.tar.gz
2. Copy the ATFrogs.war archive from the extracted folder
   ATFrogs-1.0/build/ to the tomcat webapps directory:
     cp ATFrogs-1.0/build/ATFrogs.war /usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/.
3. Now create a new directory for the ATFrogs web application
   and unzip the ATFrogs.war archive into it:
     mkdir /usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/ATFrogs
     unzip /usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/ATFrogs.war \
            -d /usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/ATFrogs
4. For using the application the permissions have to be changed:
     chown -R tomcat /usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/ATFrogs
     chgrp -R tomcat /usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/ATFrogs

ATFrogs is now installed. But a few config files and directories
must be created for using it. When editing one of the config files
please make a backup of the original files.

5. Edit the file /etc/ox/admintools.conf. At the end of the file
   a temporary file for the ox scripts is defined. For using the
   the scripts by ATFrogs, the tomcat user must be allowed to
   write this file. Therefore change the line from
       TMPDIF="/var/ox/temporary_ldap_scripts.ldif"
   to
       TMPDIF="/var/ox/tmp/temporary_ldap_scripts.ldif"
   Now the tomcat user must be allowed to read this file:
     chown tomcat /etc/ox/admintools.conf
6. After this, create the specified directory and change the
   permissions:
     mkdir /var/ox/tmp
     chown -R tomcat /var/ox/tmp
     chgrp -R tomcat /var/ox/tmp
7. For the logfiles of ATFrogs, a new directory must be created
   and the permissions have to be changed:
     mkdir /var/log/ATFrogs
     chown -R tomcat /var/log/ATFrogs
     chgrp -R tomcat /var/log/ATFrogs
8. Edit the file /usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/ATFrogs/WEB-INF/web.xml.
   This file contains the settings for ATFrogs. For example the
   directory for the log files is specified here.
   The only setting you must change is the password of the mailadmin.
   It is needed for the webdav querys. Set it to the same password of
   the user from the groupware.
   Search for
       <param-name>pass</param-name>
       <param-value>Kennwort</param-value>
   and change "Kennwort" to your password of the mailadmin user.
9. Edit the file /usr/share/tomcat5/conf/server.xml. These file
   contains of all setting for the whole tomcat server. Here the
   LDAP realm for the authentification against the LDAP server
   must be defined. Therefore go to the end of the file. You find
   this:
          <Logger className="org.apache.catalina.logger.FileLogger"
                  directory="logs"  prefix="localhost_log." suffix=".txt"
                  timestamp="true"/>

          </Host>

        </Engine>

      </Service>

    </Server>
   Insert between the "Logger" (<Logger ...) and the closing "</Host>" tag
   the following:
    <Context path="/ATFrogs" docBase="ATFrogs" debug="9"
             reloadable="true" >
    <Realm className="org.apache.catalina.realm.JNDIRealm" debug="99"
           connectionName="cn=Manager,dc=YOUR_COMPAMY,dc=de"
           connectionPassword="YOUR_LDAP_PASSWD"
           connectionURL="ldap://localhost:389"
           userSearch="(uid={1})"
           userPassword="userPassword"
           userPattern="uid={0},ou=Users,ou=OxObjects,
                                            dc=YOUR_COMPANY,dc=de"
           roleBase="ou=Groups,ou=OxObjects,dc=YOUR_COMPANY,dc=de"
           roleName="cn"
           roleSearch="(memberUid={1})"
           roleSubtree="false"
           digest="SHA"/>
     </Context>
    Change the words in upper case (YOUR_COMPANY and YOUR_LDAP_PASSWD)
    to the parameter you have choosen by the installation of ox.

Now the installation is complete and the tomcat server can be
restartet:
     service tomcat5 restart

Now all user of the groupware group ATFrogsUsers can access ATFrogs by
going to http://your-groupware:8080/ATFrogs.
If the group does not exist, create it and add the mailadmin to it:
     addgroup_ox --group=ATFrogsUsers
     addusertogroup --user=mailadmin --group=ATFrogsUsers

Note that all ATFrogs user must crypt their password with SHA. This
can be done in the groupware (setup).
