If any errors during installation or usage of ATFrogs occur, you should always 
execute the following procedures:

- Analyze the error message in ATFrogs
- Take a look at the ATFrogs log files
- Take a look at the tomcat log files.

Note:
If the attribut 'logLevel' within the file web.xml ist set to 'off' no
messages
are written to the tomcat log files. With level 'debug' the amount of logged
information is the highest.

(1) No access to tomcat manager
Description: 
No access to tomcat at http://[myOxServer]:8080.
Possible solution:
Check the preferences of your firewall related to port 8080. You should at 
least have access to http://localhost:8080 from your server.

(2) Web-application not listed in tomcat manager
Description:
After having installed the ATFrogs web-application by means of the tomcat 
manager the application is not listed within the list of installed applications.
Possible solution:
User 'tomcat' does not have the appropriate rights in tomcat folder 
$TOMCATHOME/webapps/. You should change this by executing
'chown -R tomcat $TOMCATHOME/webapps'.

(3) Login to ATFrogs not possible
Description: 
The ATFrogs login page is shown but login is not possible.
Possible solution:
Possibly username or password are not correct or the authentification in file
server.xml is not correctly set. The 'localhost' log files can give more 
information. Additionaly assert that the user in the group containing the 
ATFrogs users. Note that the user's password must be encrypted by the 
algorithm specified in server.xml within parameter 'digest'. If this is the
problem login to the groupware and store your password at categorie 'setup'
(after having chosen the encryption method from list box).

(4) Error message after having logged in
Description:
Login to ATFrogs was successful but instead of an ATFrogs module an 
error message eccors.
Possible solution:
You should take a look into the tomcat log files. Probably the credentials of
the user listed in web.xml are wrong or the user is not in a Open-XChange(tm)
group. Additionaly assert that Open-XChange(tm)'s webDAV is installed correctly.

(5) The logger cannot be initialized
Description:
Login to ATFrogs is successful but instead of an ATFrogs module a message
saying
'cannot initiate logger' occurs.
Possible solution:
User tomcat does not have the appropriate rights in the folder to put the 
ATFrogs log files to or the directory does not exist. Please check your 
web.xml settings.
